##  Features

-  Multiple Levels (Level 1, 2, 3)
-  Ghosts (NPCs) with basic AI movement
-  Score tracking and life system
-  Fruit and coin collectibles
-  Power-ups and level transitions
-  Sound effects with WinMM (e.g. ghost defeat, fruit collected)
-  Game instructions and welcome screen
-  Cool ASCII Art for a classic arcade feel

##  Technologies Used

- **Assembly Language (x86)**
- **Irvine32 Library** (for input/output and graphics)
- **WinMM.lib** (for audio playback)

##  How to Run

1. Make sure you have **MASM** and the **Irvine32 library** set up on your system.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RGRIDER/asm-pacman.git
   ```
3. Open the `.asm` file in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio with MASM support).
4. Compile and run the project.
5. Make sure sound files are placed correctly (modify paths if needed in `sound1`, `sound2`, etc.).
6. Use your keyboard to play — instructions are available in-game!
