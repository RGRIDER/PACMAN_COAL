A classic Pac-Man game reimagined in low-level glory using Assembly Language and the Irvine32 library!
This project is a console-based version of Pac-Man where you control the hungry yellow circle (a.k.a Pac-Man) through different maze levels, gobbling up dots, avoiding ghosts, and collecting fruit â€” all rendered with characters and pure logic!

ðŸ”§ Built With:
  â€¢	Assembly Language (x86)
  â€¢	Irvine32 Library
  â€¢	WinMM for sound effects (ghostkill, death, fruit munch, etc.)
ðŸŽ® Features:
  â€¢	Multiple levels (Level 1, 2, 3)
  â€¢	Ghost AI (basic NPC movement)
  â€¢	Score tracking and life count

  â€¢	ASCII-based splash screen and rules panel
  â€¢	Nostalgic sound effects triggered at events
ðŸ§  Why Assembly? Because who doesn't like a challenge? Writing this game in Assembly really helped me understand memory, logic flow, and system-level interaction.
